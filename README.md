I have over five years of experience in the health care field working in different pilot project roles, and I’m now planning a transition into the tech field.  Although, I enjoy helping and making a difference in the health care field, I realized that I enjoy the challenge that comes with creating something from scratch. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a full stack developer; I’ve enrolled at Promineo Tech in their Front-End Software Development program. And upon completion, I plan to enroll into their Back-End Software Development program.  

Outside of work and boot camp, you’ll catch me at home improvement stores purchasing materials for my next house project. In addition to this, you’ll find me spending time outdoors or occasionally traveling for mini weekend trip to see the many state parks in the surrounding states to Minnesota.

I also enjoy meeting new individuals over a cup of coffee or tea. I believe there’s something we could teach each other based on our experiences; we are never too old to learn something new.
